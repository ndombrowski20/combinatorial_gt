# combinatoric_gt
This serves as the repository dedicated to my work at the SNRG lab at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A report was completed for the project for which this code was constructed which is available upon request. I can be reached at ndombrowski20@gmail.com or at ndombro1@nd.edu.

The goal of the project was to create a program which can be fed generators and relators and create a quotient group based off of these generators and relators. From there, this data is taken and made into a Cayley graph. All design decisions are made clear in the report that accompanies the project. 

One may notice that the changes happened all at once. This code was moved from a 'work in progress' repository to this one in order to make the structure of the program as well as the breadth of the classes clearer.
